You are the black square on the left side of the grid. Your goal is to navigate to the dark blue square on the right side of the grid. After the application loads, you can navigate by either using your keyboard arrow keys or the direction buttons. If you hit too many obstacles and loose all of your health, you will loose but can choose to reset. Also, if you win by reaching the target square, you can reset and continue playing.
